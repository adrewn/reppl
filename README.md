reppl
=====

The simplest possible REPeatable project PipeLine.

This is a very basic system for managing chains and pipelines of formulas, pushing updates through the whole picture.
This is not the final system that will be used by repeatr, though it may have some similar traits.

(It's also feels a bit like a [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)
for repeatr formulas, since it evaluates and prints after each step, hence the name.)
